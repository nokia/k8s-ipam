# A Native Kubernetes IPAM

The IPAM is a kubernetes native IP address management, which supports:
- virtual networks to allow for overlapping IP(s)
- IP addresses, IP prefixes, IP pools and IP ranges within a virtual network
- A k8s api using CRD(s) for configuring and allocating IP addresses within a virtual network
- A GRPC API for allocating and deallocating IP addresses/prefixes/pools
- labels as selectors for IP address allocation or to provide metadata to the ipam resource
- IPv6 and IPv4 in single stack or dual stack mode

## ipam logic and terminology
â—Š
The IPAM has multiple network contexts (implemented as network-instances) that can have multiple prefixes that can be nested. The top prefix of a nested hierarchy is called an aggregated prefix. At the bottom layer we can have IP ranges or IP addresses that are allocated from within a prefix.

![ipam hierarchy](ipam-hierarchy.jpg)

Prefix - A subnet defined within an aggregate prefix. Prefixes extend the hierarchy by nesting within one another. (For example, 2000:1:1::/64 will appear within 2000:1::/48.)

IP Range - An arbitrary range of individual IP addresses within a prefix, all sharing the same mask. (out of scope for now)

IP Address - An individual IP address along with its subnet mask, automatically arranged beneath its parent prefix.

The actual IPPrefix CRD does not distinguish between an address or a prefix, since an address is a special case of a prefix. An address has a /128 or /32 for ipv6, ipv4 resp.

### ipam use cases

Everything in the IPAM is modelled as an IP Prefix. An IP address is a specific implementation of an IP prefix, meaning is is resp /32 or /128 for ipv4 and ipv6. Besides the IP address There are various use cases for an IP Prefix, like interface based IP(s), loopback based IPs and IP pools/ranges. In order to allow for flexibility a prefix kind is introduced and hence an ip prefix can have various kinds:

- Aggregate: 
  - IP Prefixes are naturally hierarchical and are typically drawn from a specific space that someone operates with. An aggregate prefix-kind can be seen as the top level when nesting IP prefixes. E.g. if an operator got a IP prefix assigned from the RIR it would be implemented as an aggergate. 
  - An aggregate can be nested. E.g. if someone wants to subdivide an address space they can define multiple aggregates where multiple teams operate with.
  - Children of an aggregate IP prefix can be of kind: network, pool and loopback
  - Parents of an aggregate IP prefix can be of kind: aggregate
- network: 
  - IP prefixes that are assigned on (virtual/physical) interfaces of a application would be modelled as a prefix kind network. IP prefixes of this kind can have a mesh relationship between them. E.g. a LAN environment can have multiple routers and hosts that all are in the same subnet.
  - Children of a network IP prefix can be of kind: network
  - Parents of a network IP prefix can be of kind: aggregate
- pool:
  - IP prefixes can also be assigned to pools. E.g. a pool for a DHCP server, a pool for NAT, a pool for allocating IP adddresses to users. The IP prefix of kind pool allows for this use case
  - Children of a pool IP prefix can be of kind: pool
  - Parents of a pool IP prefix can be of kind: aggregate or pool
- loopback
  - IP prefixes can also be assigned to a loopback interface in the application. E.g. a socket for a RADIUS server, Diameter, HTTP srever. The IP prefix of kind loopback allows for this use case
  - Children of a loopback IP prefix can be of kind: loopback
  - Parents of a loopback IP prefix can be of kind: aggregate 

## Injector

Besides the base IPAM block there is also a injector functions which looks at IP Allocations within a GitRepo/package revision and allocates/deallocates IP(s) using a GRPC interface. This is a pluggable system which allows to interact with 3rd party IPAM systems.

## use cases

### run IPAM

```
make run
```

### run IPAM using kpt

```
kpt live init blueprint/ipam
kpt live apply blueprint/ipam
```

### Setup IPAM

To steup the IPAM, one needs to configure a virtual network, implemented through a network-instance

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1
kind: NetworkInstance
metadata:
  name: vpc-1
spec:
EOF
```

The next step is to create a prefix from which ip addresses can be allocated.

A network prefix example with a gateway.

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1
kind: IPPrefix
metadata:
  name: net1-prefix1
  labels:
    nephio.org/gateway: "true"
spec:
  prefix: 10.0.1.1/24
  network: net1
  networkInstance: vpc-1
EOF
```

An aggregated prefix example

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1
kind: IPPrefix
metadata:
  name: aggregate0
spec:
  kind: aggregate
  prefix: 10.0.0.0/8
  networkInstance: vpc-1
EOF
```

To verify the status in the system we can use the following command

```
kubectl get ipam
```

The output will look like this

```
NAME                                    SYNC   STATUS   NETWORK   KIND        NETWORK   PREFIX-REQ    PREFIX-ALLOC   AGE
ipprefix.ipam.nephio.org/aggregate0     True   True     vpc-1     aggregate             10.0.0.0/8    10.0.0.0/8     5s
ipprefix.ipam.nephio.org/net1-prefix1   True   True     vpc-1     network     net1      10.0.1.1/24   10.0.1.1/24    75s

NAME                                    SYNC   STATUS   AGE
networkinstance.ipam.nephio.org/vpc-1   True   True     2m44s
```

To view the IPAM IP allocation we can look at the allocations under the network-instance

```
kubectl describe  networkinstances.ipam.nephio.org network-1
```

The output will look like this

```
k describe networkinstances.ipam.nephio.org network-1
Name:         vpc-1
Namespace:    default
API Version:  ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1

### IP address allocation 

To request an IP address from the IPAM system we either use the K8s or the GRPC API.
By providing a network-instance and network-name label-selector an IP address will be allocated
from an IPAM prefix that matches these labels.

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1
kind: IPAllocation
metadata:
  name: alloc1
spec:
  kind: network
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      nephio.org/network-instance:  vpc-1
      nephio.org/network-name: net1
EOF
```

A prefix and parent prefix is allocated

```
NAME                                  SYNC   STATUS   KIND      AF    PREFIXLENGTH   PREFIX-REQ   PREFIX-ALLOC   GATEWAY    AGE
ipallocation.ipam.nephio.org/alloc1   True   True     network                                     10.0.1.2/32    10.0.1.1   4s
```

### static IP address allocation 

To support static or determinsitic IP allocation a predetermined IP is allocated using the IP Prefix API, that sets a specific label e.g. key: nephio.org/interface value: n3. Any key and value can be used other thna the system defined once

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1
kind: IPPrefix
metadata:
  name: net1-prefix10
  labels:
    nephio.org/interface: n3
spec:
  prefix: 10.0.1.10/24
  network: net1
  networkInstance: vpc-1
EOF
```

By referencing this label in the label selector we can allocate the IP that was statically allocated

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1
kind: IPAllocation
metadata:
  name: alloc2-n3
spec:
  kind: network
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      nephio.org/network-instance:  vpc-1
      nephio.org/network-name: net1
      nephio.org/interface: n3
EOF
```

```
NAME                                     SYNC   STATUS   NETWORK   KIND        NETWORK   PREFIX-REQ     PREFIX-ALLOC   AGE
ipprefix.ipam.nephio.org/aggregate0      True   True     vpc-1     aggregate             10.0.0.0/8     10.0.0.0/8     19m
ipprefix.ipam.nephio.org/net1-prefix1    True   True     vpc-1     network     net1      10.0.1.1/24    10.0.1.1/24    21m
ipprefix.ipam.nephio.org/net1-prefix10   True   True     vpc-1     network     net1      10.0.1.10/24   10.0.1.10/24   14m

NAME                                     SYNC   STATUS   KIND      AF    PREFIXLENGTH   PREFIX-REQ   PREFIX-ALLOC   GATEWAY     AGE
ipallocation.ipam.nephio.org/alloc1      True   True     network                                     10.0.1.11/32   10.0.1.0    17m
ipallocation.ipam.nephio.org/alloc2-n3   True   True     network                                     10.0.1.10/32   10.0.1.10   11m
```

### GW IP address allocation

To request the GW IP of the prefix, we use the following mechanism:

- First when creating the IP prefix we create it using the following notation 10.0.0.1/24. As such the .1 is allocated by the IPAM as a gateway IP automatically.

Allocate an IP with the ephio.org/gateway: "true" label in the label selector

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1
kind: IPPrefix
metadata:
  name: net1-prefix1
  labels:
    nephio.org/gateway: "true"
spec:
  prefix: 10.0.1.1/24
  network: net1
  networkInstance: vpc-1
EOF
```

Now also the GW IP will be referenced

```
kubectl get ipam
```

```
NAME                                     SYNC   STATUS   NETWORK   KIND        NETWORK   PREFIX-REQ     PREFIX-ALLOC   AGE
ipprefix.ipam.nephio.org/aggregate0      True   True     vpc-1     aggregate             10.0.0.0/8     10.0.0.0/8     19m
ipprefix.ipam.nephio.org/net1-prefix1    True   True     vpc-1     network     net1      10.0.1.1/24    10.0.1.1/24    21m
ipprefix.ipam.nephio.org/net1-prefix10   True   True     vpc-1     network     net1      10.0.1.10/24   10.0.1.10/24   14m

NAME                                     SYNC   STATUS   KIND      AF    PREFIXLENGTH   PREFIX-REQ   PREFIX-ALLOC   GATEWAY     AGE
ipallocation.ipam.nephio.org/alloc1      True   True     network                                     10.0.1.11/32   10.0.1.0    17m
ipallocation.ipam.nephio.org/alloc2-n3   True   True     network                                     10.0.1.10/32   10.0.1.10   11m
```

### pool allocation

To allocate a pool we speific the prefix length and the network-instance that should match

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: ipam.nephio.org/v1alpha1
kind: IPAllocation
metadata:
  name: alloc-pool1
spec:
  kind: pool
  prefixLength: 16
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      nephio.org/network-instance:  vpc-1
EOF
```

```
kubectl get get ipallocations.ipam.nephio.org
```

```
NAME                                       SYNC   STATUS   KIND      AF    PREFIXLENGTH   PREFIX-REQ   PREFIX-ALLOC   GATEWAY     AGE
ipallocation.ipam.nephio.org/alloc-pool1   True   True     pool            16                          10.1.0.0/16                4s
```
